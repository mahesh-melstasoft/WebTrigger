- ✅ **Operations** - Deployment guides, monitoring setup

---

## 📅 Weekly Snapshots

```
WEEK 1:  Input validation schemas + error handling setup
WEEK 2:  Test framework + API docs + structured logging
WEEK 3:  Service credentials + action UI components
WEEK 4:  SMS actions + webhook retry strategy
WEEK 5:  Security hardening + performance testing
WEEK 6:  Optimization + deployment + RELEASE v1.0.0
```

## 🚦 Decision Gates

| Gate | Criteria | When |
|------|----------|------|
| **GATE 1** | Validation & errors working | End Week 1 |
| **GATE 2** | Foundation complete (60%+ coverage) | End Week 2 |
| **GATE 3** | Service credentials ready | End Week 3 |
| **GATE 4** | All features complete | End Week 4 |
| **GATE 5** | Security audit passed | End Week 5 |
| **GATE 6** | Production ready | End Week 6 |

Each gate must pass before proceeding to next phase.

## 💡 Strategic Approach

### ✅ What We're Doing Right
1. **Phase-based delivery** - Each phase has clear, achievable goals
2. **Quality first** - Build foundation before features
3. **Security conscious** - Security hardening built-in, not bolted-on
4. **Test-driven** - Comprehensive testing from day 1
5. **Documentation** - Every feature documented as built
6. **Risk management** - Identified risks with mitigations

### ⚠️ What Could Go Wrong (and We'll Prevent)
1. **Scope creep** - Locked scope, deferred features to v1.1
2. **Testing gaps** - Daily coverage checks
3. **Performance issues** - Early load testing
4. **Security vulnerabilities** - Code review process + audit
5. **Deployment surprises** - Staging environment exactly like prod

## 🎓 Key Technologies

| Component | Technology | Why? |
|-----------|-----------|------|
| Validation | **Zod** | Type-safe, composable schemas |
| Testing | **Vitest** | Fast, native ESM, Jest-compatible |
| Logging | **Pino** | High performance, structured JSON |
| Documentation | **OpenAPI** | Industry standard, interactive |
| SMS | **Twilio** | Reliable, well-documented |
| Database | **Prisma** | Already in use, type-safe |
