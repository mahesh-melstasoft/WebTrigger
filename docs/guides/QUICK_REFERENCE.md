## 🛠️ Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): Foundation

### What to Build
```
✓ Input Validation (Zod)
✓ Error Handling (unified format)
✓ Test Suite (Vitest, 60%+ coverage)
✓ API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
✓ Structured Logging (Pino)
```

### Dependencies to Add
```bash
npm install zod
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui
npm install pino pino-pretty
```

### Day-by-Day
- **Days 1-2**: Validation schemas
- **Days 3-4**: Error handling + middleware
- **Day 5**: Test framework setup
- **Days 6-7**: First unit tests
- **Days 8-9**: Integration tests + API docs
- **Days 10**: Logging + review

---

## 🚀 Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): Features

### What to Build
```
✓ Service Credentials (encrypted)
✓ Action Management UI
✓ SMS Actions (Twilio)
✓ Webhook Retry Strategy (exponential backoff + DLQ)
```

### Dependencies to Add
```bash
npm install twilio
npm install @asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi
```

### Day-by-Day
- **Days 11-12**: Credential encryption
- **Days 13-14**: Action UI components
- **Days 15-16**: SMS action framework
- **Days 17-18**: SMS testing + Twilio integration
- **Days 19-20**: Retry strategy design + implementation

---

## 🔒 Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): Scale & Security

### What to Build
```
✓ Security Hardening (keys, audit logs, rate limiting)
✓ Performance Testing (load tests, bottleneck identification)
✓ Deployment Guides (Vercel, self-hosted, ops)
✓ Production Release
```

### Day-by-Day
- **Days 21-22**: API key hashing + audit logging
- **Days 23-24**: Rate limiting + security headers
- **Day 25**: Performance baseline testing
- **Days 26-27**: Performance optimization
- **Days 28-29**: Deployment guide documentation
- **Days 30**: Final QA + v1.0.0 release

## 🎯 Critical Path (Don't Skip!)

```
1. VALIDATION    (blocks: everything else)
   ↓
2. ERROR HANDLING (blocks: testing)
   ↓
3. TEST SETUP    (blocks: confident refactoring)
   ↓
4. SERVICE CREDS (blocks: SMS/Email)
   ↓
5. RETRIES       (blocks: reliable delivery)
   ↓
6. SECURITY      (blocks: production)
   ↓
RELEASE ✓
```
