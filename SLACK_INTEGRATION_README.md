## Troubleshooting

### Test Button Not Working
- Verify your Slack webhook URL is correct
- Make sure the URL starts with `https://hooks.slack.com/`
- Check that your Slack app has permission to post to the selected channel

### Not Receiving Notifications
- Confirm your webhook URL is saved in WebTrigger settings
- Check that your Slack app is active and has webhook permissions
- Verify the selected Slack channel exists and is accessible

### Webhook Still Works But No Slack Message
- The Slack notification failure won't affect your webhook execution
- Check the server logs for any Slack-related errors
- Verify your webhook URL hasn't expired or been revoked

## Security Notes

- ‚úÖ Webhook URLs are stored securely in your database
- ‚úÖ Only you can view and modify your Slack webhook URL
- ‚úÖ Slack notifications include your email for identification
- ‚úÖ Failed Slack notifications don't break webhook functionality

## Rate Limits

- Slack has rate limits for webhook messages
- WebTrigger includes automatic retry logic for failed Slack sends
- If Slack is temporarily unavailable, notifications will be lost (this is by design to not slow down webhooks)
