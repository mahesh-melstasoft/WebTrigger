# WebTrigger UI/UX Improvement Prompts

## Design System & Visual Consistency

### Prompt 1: Unified Background System
```
Create a consistent background system for WebTrigger that provides visual hierarchy and brand cohesion across all pages. The system should:

1. Define 3-4 background variants:
   - Hero/landing pages: Subtle animated gradients
   - Content pages: Clean, minimal backgrounds
   - Modal/forms: Focused, distraction-free backgrounds
   - Data-heavy pages: Optimized for readability

2. Technical requirements:
   - CSS custom properties for easy theming
   - Performance-optimized animations (reduce motion support)
   - Mobile-responsive with appropriate performance considerations
   - Accessibility-compliant contrast ratios

3. Implementation approach:
   - Create reusable CSS classes
   - Provide React components with background props
   - Include animation controls for user preferences
   - Document usage patterns and performance guidelines

Current inconsistency: Landing page and dashboard use animated gradients, while settings/billing/auth pages use plain gray backgrounds.
```
